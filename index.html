<p>Your challenge as a ScrumMaster today is that when you have a problem, you Google, and you find fifteen different – but often contradictory – answers. Worse, many of the alleged solutions address <em>symptoms</em> but fail to solve the initial problem or make it even worse.</p>

<p>Just like Scrum, we won’t solve your problems for you, but we’ll prompt you to identify and start at the root of many challenges, and give you the tools and guidance to help you do so.</p>

<p>This also isn’t just about Scrum – we also like Kanban and other flavours of Agile. Scrum Coach in a Box won’t replace a good ScrumMaster or Product Owner: It is a resource to help them, and their teams, solve common, challenging problems.</p>
