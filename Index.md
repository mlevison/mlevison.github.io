# Welcome to Scrum Coach In A Box

Your challenge as a ScrumMaster today is that when you have a problem, you Google, and you find fifteen different – but often contradictory – answers. Worse, many of the alleged solutions solve the _symptom_ but make the initial problem worse.

Just like Scrum, we won’t solve your problems for you, but we’ll prompt you to identify and start at the root of many challenges, and give you the tools and guidance to help you do so.

This isn’t just about Scrum - we also like Kanban and other flavors of Agile. And this won’t replace a good ScrumMaster or Product Owner. Scrum Coach in a Box is a resource to help them, and their teams, solve common, challenging problems.
